      <h4>What is a Thread?</h4>
      <p>A thread is a collection of resources.</p>

      <h4>What is a Resource?</h4>
      <p>A resource is a URL (e.g. "http://www.google.com"). A resource can be in as many threads you you'd like.</p>

      <h4>Adding a Resource to a Thread</h4>
      <p>To add the current URL to the current thread, just click the <b><i class="fa fa-star"></i> Add to Thread</b> button. If the resource is already in your knowledge network, just grab the <i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> and drag 'n' drop it onto the name of the thread that you'd like to add the resource to.</p>

      <h4>Connecting Resources</h4>
      <p>Resources can be connected together to improve the organization of your knowledge network. To connect two resources, just grab the <i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> and drag 'n' drop it onto another <i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o"></i> <em>Hint: This is where the magic starts happening</em></p>

      <h4>Importing Thread(s) from File</h4>
      <p>Congratulations, someone has given you a thread to import! Just press the <i class="fa fa-cloud-download"></i> button and select the file. <em>Hint: The file type is .json</em>.</p>

      <h4>Importing Resources from your Chrome Bookmarks</h4>
      <p>This is the <b>easiest</b> way to get started. Just press the <i class="fa fa-download"></i> button. <em>Hint: This may take up to 30 seconds if you have a lot of bookmarks.</em></p>

      <h4>Export Thread to File</h4>
      <p>Sweet, you're ready to share how you've learned something! Just press the <i class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></i> button and choose a file name to save the thread to. Then, you can send it to whomever you like!</p>
